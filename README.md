# No-Display-Cutout
Want to get rid of the cutout on your Android device’s screen? This module will allow you to hide it. The module was initially designed for custom ROMs where the cutout was displayed incorrectly and was larger than the camera. However, the module will also help you run games in full-screen mode, ignoring the cutout.

# Disclaimer
This module might not work on some Android version or custom ROM. It’s been tested on Redmi Note 8 with Pixel Experience A13 and works great there.

# How to install
This module needs Magisk or Magisk Delta (root access). Go to the Modules tab and pick the ZIP file.
